the next one\n * that was passed.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Execute series of Observables no matter what, even if it means swallowing errors.</span>\n *\n * <img src=\"./img/onErrorResumeNext.png\" width=\"100%\">\n *\n * `onErrorResumeNext` is an operator that accepts a series of Observables, provided either directly as\n * arguments or as an array. If no single Observable is provided, returned Observable will simply behave the same\n * as the source.\n *\n * `onErrorResumeNext` returns an Observable that starts by subscribing and re-emitting values from the source Observable.\n * When its stream of values ends - no matter if Observable completed or emitted an error - `onErrorResumeNext`\n * will subscribe to the first Observable that was passed as an argument to the method. It will start re-emitting\n * its values as well and - again - when that stream ends, `onErrorResumeNext` will proceed to subscribing yet another\n * Observable in provided series, no matter if previous Observable completed or ended with an error. This will\n * be happening until there is no more Observables left in the series, at which point returned Observable will\n * complete - even if the last subscribed stream ended with an error.\n *\n * `onErrorResumeNext` can be therefore though of as version of {@link concat} operator, which is more permissive\n * when it comes to the errors emitted by its input Observables. While `concat` subscribes to the next Observable\n * in series only if previous one successfully completed, `onErrorResumeNext` subscribes even if it ended with\n * an error.\n *\n * Note that you do not get any access to errors emitted by the Observables. In particular do not\n * expect these errors to appear in error callback passed to {@link subscribe}. If you want to take\n * specific actions based on what error was emitted by an Observable, you should try out {@link catch} instead.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Subscribe to the next Observable after map fails</caption>\n * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3, 0)\n *   .map(x => {\n *       if (x === 0) { throw Error(); }\n         return 10 / x;\n *   })\n *   .onErrorResumeNext(Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3))\n *   .subscribe(\n *     val => console.log(val),\n *     err => console.log(err),          // Will never be called.\n *     () => console.log('that\\'s it!')\n *   );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 10\n * // 5\n * // 3.3333333333333335\n * // 1\n * // 2\n * // 3\n * // \"that's it!\"\n *\n * @see {@link concat}\n * @see {@link catch}\n *\n * @param {...ObservableInput} observables Observables passed either directly or as an array.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that emits values from source Observable, but - if it errors - subscribes\n * to the next passed Observable and so on, until it completes or runs out of Observables.\n * @method onErrorResumeNext\n * @owner Observable\n */\n\nexport function onErrorResumeNext<T, R>(this: Observable<T>, ...nextSources:

class=\"informal\">Give it a function `f` of type `f(x, callback)` and\n   * it will return a function `g` that when called as `g(x)` will output an\n   * Observable.</span>\n   *\n   * `bindCallback` is not an operator because its input and output are not\n   * Observables. The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the\n   * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n   * done.\n   *\n   * The output of `bindCallback` is a function that takes the same parameters\n   * as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output function\n   * is called with arguments, it will return an Observable. If `func` function\n   * calls its callback with one argument, the Observable will emit that value.\n   * If on the other hand callback is called with multiple values, resulting\n   * Observable will emit an array with these arguments.\n   *\n   * It is very important to remember, that input function `func` is not called\n   * when output function is, but rather when Observable returned by output\n   * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes AJAX request, that request\n   * will be made every time someone subscribes to resulting Observable, but not before.\n   *\n   * Optionally, selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. That function\n   * takes the same arguments as callback, and returns value\n   * that will be emitted by Observable instead of callback parameters themselves.\n   * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as array,\n   * selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as callback would.\n   * This means you can imagine default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)\n   * as function that aggregates all its arguments into array, or simply returns first argument,\n   * if there is only one.\n   *\n   * Last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when call\n   * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n   * passed to callback will be emitted. By default subscription to Observable calls `func`\n   * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as last parameter will defer call to input function,\n   * just like wrapping that call in `setTimeout` with time `0` would. So if you use async Scheduler\n   * and call `subscribe` on output Observable, all function calls that are currently executing,\n   * will end before `func` is invoked.\n   *\n   * When it comes to emitting results passed to callback, by default they are emitted\n   * immediately after `func` invokes callback. In particular, if callback is called synchronously,\n   * then subscription to resulting Observable will call `next` function synchronously as well.\n   * If you want to defer that call, using `Scheduler.async` will, again, do the job.\n   * This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can, in a sense, ensure that `func`\n   * always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n   *\n   * Note that Observable created by output function will always emit only one value\n   * and then complete right after. Even if `func` calls callback multiple times, values from\n   * second and following calls will never appear in the stream. If you need to\n   * listen for multiple calls, you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or\n   * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n   *\n   * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property), that context will be set\n   * to the same context that output function has at call time.

The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the\n   * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n   * done. The callback function is expected to follow Node.js conventions,\n   * where the first argument to the callback is an error object, signaling\n   * whether call was successful. If that object is passed to callback, it means\n   * something went wrong.\n   *\n   * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same\n   * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output\n   * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.\n   * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will\n   * error with that value as well. If error parameter is not passed, Observable will emit\n   * second parameter. If there are more parameters (third and so on),\n   * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.\n   *\n   * Optionally `bindNodeCallback` accepts selector function, which allows you to\n   * make resulting Observable emit value computed by selector, instead of regular\n   * callback arguments. It works similarly to {@link bindCallback} selector, but\n   * Node.js-style error argument will never be passed to that function.\n   *\n   * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,\n   * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to\n   * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed\n   * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler\n   * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.\n   * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where\n   * Scheduler works exactly the same.\n   *\n   * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context\n   * of returned function, when it is called.\n   *\n   * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means\n   * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive\n   * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions\n   * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or\n   * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n   *\n   * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.\n   * \"Node.js-style\" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for\n   * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,\n   * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.\n   *\n   * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance\n   * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.\n   * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as \"present\", when value\n   * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty\n   * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error\n   * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when\n   * `bindNodeCallback` is used. If your Observable errors much more often then you\n   * would expect, check if callback really is called in Node.js-style and, if not,\n   * switch to {@link bindCallback} instead.\n   *\n   * Note that even if error parameter is technically present in callback, but its value\n   * is falsy, it still won't appear in array emitted by Observable or in selector function.\n   *\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Read a file from the filesystem and get the data as an Observable</caption>\n   * import * as fs from 'fs';\n   * var readFileAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(fs.readFile);\n   * var result = readFileAsObservable('./roadNames.txt', 'utf8');\n   * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n   *\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback with multiple arguments</caption>\n   * someFunction((err, a, b) => {\n   *   console.log(err); // null\n   *   console.log(a); // 5\n   *   console.log(b); // \"some string\"\n   * });\n   * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n   * boundSomeFunction()\n   * .subscribe(value => {\n   *   console.log(value); // [5, \"some string\"]\n   * });\n   *\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Use with selector function</caption>\n   * someFunction((err, a, b) => {\n   *   console.log(err); // undefined\n   *   console.log(a); // \"abc\"\n   *   console.log(b); // \"DEF\"\n   * });\n   * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction, (a, b) => a + b);\n   * boundSomeFunction()\n   * .subscribe(value => {\n   *   console.log(value); // \"abcDEF\"\n   * });\n   *\n   *\n   * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback in regular style</caption>\n   * someFunction(a => {\n   *   console.log(a); // 5\n   * });\n   * var boundSomeFunction = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n   * boundSomeFunction()\n   * .subscribe(\n   *   value => {}             // never gets called\n   *   err => console.log(err) // 5\n   *);\n   *\n   *\n   * @see {@link bindCallback}\n   * @see {@link from}\n   * @see {@link fromPromise}\n   *\n   * @param {function} func Function with a Node.js-style callback as the last parameter.\n   * @param {function} [selector] A function which takes the arguments from the\n   * callback and maps those to a value to emit on the output Observable.\n   * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler] The scheduler on which to schedule the\n   * callbacks.\n   * @return {function(...params: *): Observable} A function which returns the\n   * Observable that delivers the same values the Node.js callback would\n   * deliver.\n   * @static true\n   * @name bindNodeCallback\n   * @owner Observable\n   */\n  static create<T>(func: Function,\n                   selector: Function | void = undefined,\n                   scheduler?: IScheduler): (...args: any[]) => Observable<T> {\n    return function(this: any, ...args: any[]): Observable<T> {\n      return new BoundNodeCallbackObservable<T>(func, <any>selector, args, this, scheduler);\n    };\n  }\n\n  constructor(private callbackFunc: Function,\n              private selector: Function,\n              private args: any[],\n              private context: any,\n              public scheduler: IScheduler) {\n    super();\n  }\n\n  protected _subscribe(subscriber: Subscriber<T | T[]>): Subscription {\n    const callbackFunc = this.callbackFunc;\n    const args = this.args;\n    const scheduler = this.scheduler;\n    let subject = this.subject;\n\n    if (!scheduler) {\n      if (!subject) {\n        subject = this.subject = new AsyncSubject<T>();\n        const handler = function handlerFn(this: any, ...innerArgs: any[]) {\n          const source = (<any>handlerFn).source;\n          const { selector, subject } = source;\n          const err = innerArgs.shift();\n\n          if (err) {\n            subject.error(err);\n          } else if (selector) {\n            const result = tryCatch(selector).apply(this, innerArgs);\n            if (result === errorObject) {\n              subject.error(errorObject.e);\n            } else {\n              subject.next(result);\n              subject.complete();\n            }\n          } else {\n            subject.next(innerArgs.length <= 1 ?

class=\"informal\">Whenever any input Observable emits a value, it\n * computes a formula using the latest values from all the inputs, then emits\n * the output of that formula.</span>\n *\n * <img src=\"./img/combineLatest.png\" width=\"100%\">\n *\n * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as\n * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now\n * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now\n * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);\n * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0] after 0.5s\n * // [1, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 1] after 1.5s\n * // [2, 1] after 2s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>\n * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(\n *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds\n * );\n * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);\n * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));\n * // Logs\n * // [0, 0, 0] immediately\n * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s\n * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s\n * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use project function to
